<h2> Creating a chat-bot to assist HR in recruiting the people <h2>

<h3>The purpose of the chat bot is to get all the relevant information from the Interviewee and then with help of LLMS  ask relevant interview questions.<h3>

- While creating the chat-bot it is essential to look for the model type that is suitable for the your task. 

- Cost is a big factor so also have considered that and choose the cheapest one available. 

- Used Open AI model for the chat-bot -: OpenAI "gpt-4.o"


- I have explored OpenAI play groung model parameters to finalize the parameters.
